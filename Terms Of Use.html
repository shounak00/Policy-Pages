				<br><br>
				<b>Update to the App</b>

				<br><br>
				<b>Intellectual property rights</b>
				<br><br>
				All intellectual property rights in the App and the Documentation are licensed (not sold) to you. You have no intellectual property rights in, or to, the App or the Documentation other than the right to use them in accordance with these terms.
				<br><br>
				Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you
				<br><br>
				We are not liable for business losses. The App is for domestic and private use. If you use the App for any commercial, business or resale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.
				<br><br>
				Limitations to the App. The App is provided for general information and entertainment purposes only. It does not offer advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of information obtained from the App. Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information provided by the App, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that such information is accurate, complete or up to date.
				<br><br>
				Check that the App is suitable for you. The App has not been developed to meet your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App (as described on the Appstore site and in the Documentation) meet your requirements.
				<br><br>
				We are not responsible for events outside our control. If our support for the App is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract with us and receive a refund for your inability to use the App.
				<br><br>
				We may end your rights to use the App if you break these terms.
				<br><br>
				We may end your rights to use the App at any time by contacting you if you have broken these terms in a serious way. If what you have done can be put right we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.
				<br><br>
				If we end your rights to use the App and Services:
				<ul>
					<li>You must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including your use of the App.</li>
					<li>You must delete or remove the App from all devices in your possession and immediately destroy all copies of the App which you have and confirm to us that you have done this.

				</ul>
				<br>
				We may transfer this agreement to someone else.
				<br><br>
				We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.
				<br><br>
				You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else.
				<br><br>
				You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.
				<br><br>
				If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force.
				<br><br>
				Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
				<br><br>
				Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
				<br><br>
				Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings.
				<br><br>
				These terms are governed by US law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the US courts.
